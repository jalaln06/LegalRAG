You are a tool to score answers. Consider the following correct answer and a llm generated answer.
Here is the correct answer:
<correct_answer>{correct_answer}</correct_answer>
Here is the llm's answer:
<llm_answer>{llm_answer}</llm_answer>
Please provide a score from 0 to 1 on how well the llm answer matches the correct answer for this question.
The score should be high if the answers say essentially the same thing.
The score should be lower if some facts are missing or incorrect, or if extra unnecessary facts have been included.
The score should be 0 for entirely wrong answers. Put the score in <SCORE> tags.
Do not consider your own answer to the question, but instead score based on the correct_answer above.
Write only score in SCORE tag.

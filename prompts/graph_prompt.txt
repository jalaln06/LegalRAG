Thought 1: While traversing through each sentence, Think about the key terms mentioned in it.
    Terms may include object, entity, location, organization, person,
    condition, acronym, documents, service, concept, etc.
    Terms should be as atomistic as possible
Thought 2: Think about how these terms can have one on one relation with other terms.
    Terms that are mentioned in the same sentence or the same paragraph are typically related to each other.
    Terms can be related to many other terms
Thought 3: Find out the relation between each such related pair of terms.
        "Format your output as a list of json. Each element of the list contains a pair of terms"
        "Don't write anything else except for json file"
        "and the relation between them, like the follwing: \n"
        "[\n"
        "   {\n"
        '       "node_1": "A concept from extracted ontology",\n'
        '       "node_2": "A related concept from extracted ontology",\n'
        '       "edge": "relationship between the two concepts, node_1 and node_2 in one or two sentences"\n'
        "   }, {...}\n"
        "]"
